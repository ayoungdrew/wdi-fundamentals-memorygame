<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
	Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

<p>Life is too short to take seriously. Treat it like a game! But not in a creepy nihilistic kind of way. Definitely don't do that.</p>
